# HarrysAssignment

Harry is a bright student. To prepare thoroughly for exams, he completes
all the exercises in his book! Now that the exams approaching fast, he is doing
book exercises day and night. He writes down and keeps updating the
remaining number of exercises and the back cover of each book. Harry has a lot
of books messed on the floor. Therefore, he wants to pile up the books that still
have some remaining exercises into a single pile. He will grab the books one by
one and add the books that still have remaining exercises to the top of the pile.
Whenever he wants to do a book exercise, he will pick the book with the
minimum number of remaining exercises from the pile. In order to pick the
book, he has to remove all the books above it. Therefore, if there are more than
one books with the minimum number of remaining exercises, he will take the
one which requires the least number of books to remove. The removed books
are returned to the messy floor. After he picks the book, he will do all the
remaining exercises and trash the book. Since number of books is rather large,
he needs your help to tell him the number of books he must remove, for picking
the book with the minimum number of exercises. Note that more than one book
can have the same name.
